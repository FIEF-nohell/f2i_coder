# File to Image (f2i) Converter

A better description would be encrypter. Any file placed in the input folder will be converted to an image. Multiple files are supported as well. There is still a lot of problems like the f2i speed as well as memory usage.

Converted files increase up to 250% in size!

The image to file (i2f) converter is significantly faster and works pretty well at this point.


## Dependencies

You will need Pillow, bitstring and numpy.\
